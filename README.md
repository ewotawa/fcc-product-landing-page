# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects
## Build a Product Landing Page

I built this front-end page to complete the freeCodeCamp assignment [Build a Product Landing Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page) in the Responsive Web Design certification.

If you haven't guessed already, Halloween is my favorite holiday.

The formal assignment is submitted in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ewotawa/full/PoNNMGo).
